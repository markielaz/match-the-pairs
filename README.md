# Match The Pairs

This project was just trying some things out and getting to know the DOM. 

- The game starts out with a series of paired images that are hidden from the user.
- The first 2 images the user clicks on are revealed.
- If the revelaed images match they remain uncovered.
- If the images do not match, they are hidden once again.
- The user continues until they have matched all the images.

_Additional_

- Keep track of how many guesses it took the user to complete the game.
- Randomise the starting position of the images to stop people cheating.
- tiles start blank (hidden)
- click to reveal
- after 2 clicks, reset the grid (unless matches)
- matched tiles stay revealed and greyed (unclickable)
- "play again" button on completion
- "reset" button
